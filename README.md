Backend :
* Mapping: Simplifying the understanding of intricate data connections and ensuring smooth object-relational mapping (ORM) 
for efficient backend functionality.
* Connecting to SQL: Overcoming connectivity challenges and refining SQL queries for seamless interactions with the database, 
balancing performance and dependability.
* Naming Conventions: Establishing clear and meaningful naming rules for database tables, fields, and backend code to improve 
ease of maintenance and collaboration.
 Frontend :
* User Experience (UX): Creating a user-friendly and attractive interface that suits different user needs and preferences.
* Responsive Design: Making sure the website works well on different devices and screen sizes, handling challenges in how it 
adapts and responds.
* Performance Improvement: Finding a good balance between having lots of features and making pages load quickly, solving issues 
in efficient coding and resource use.

➡️ Hardest Errors
* Resolved an internal server error related to Hibernate's nested exception - Made adjustments to the modal mapping for smoother interactions.
* Fixed an internal server error occurring while deleting nested entities - Addressed by adding the "ALL" cascade type for better entity management.
